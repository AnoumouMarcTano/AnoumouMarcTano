Hi, I'm Marc. I have a strong interest in the intersection of statistics, economics, and data analysis, with a focus on leveraging data and technology to inform public policy decisions and drive positive societal impact. Continuously enhancing my skills, I am proficient in programming languages such as Python and R, with some basic knowledge of SAS and SQL Additionally, I am highly motivated in artificial intelligence, particularly in machine learning and deep learning. I believe that integrating Al techniques with my econometric skills can yield clearer and faster insights, harnessing the predictive power of machine learning alongsidethe robust theoretical framework of econometrics. Hence, the purpose of this portfolio is to showcase several compelling projects I have worked on in these areas
